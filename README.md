Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This is an interactive web application that allows you to play tic-tac-toe against an opponent.

# Description 📚

The game is implemented according to the classic Tic Tac Toe rules, where two players alternate turns to place their symbols ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The game keeps track of winners, turns and the number of wins for each player.

# Main Functionality ⚙️

Interactive Gameplay: Interactive user interface that allows players to click boxes to make their moves.

Wins and Counters: Tracking wins for each player with counters displayed at the top of the screen.

Custom Sounds: Custom sound effects when players make moves or reset the game.

# How to Play 🎮

Click on the boxes to place your symbol. The first player to get 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins.

# Vue.js 🟢

The game was programmed using Vue.js, a javascript framework used for creating user interfaces and single-page applications.
The program has been divided into several child components and the parent App.vue component.
